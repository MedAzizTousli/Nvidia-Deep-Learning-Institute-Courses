    "\n",
    "There are a variety of important image analysis deep learning applications that need to go beyond detecting individual objects within an image and instead segment the image into spatial regions of interest. For example, in medical imagery analysis it is often important to separate the pixels corresponding to different types of tissue, blood or abnormal cells so that we can isolate a particular organ. In this self-paced, hands-on lab we will use the [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org) machine learning framework to train and evaluate an image segmentation network using a medical imagery dataset.  \n",

In this lab the task will be classifying each pixel in a cardiac MRI image based on whether the pixel is a part of the left ventricle (LV) or not.\n",

It is helpful if you've encountered convolutional neural networks (CNN) already and you understand image recognition tasks.  The lab will use Google's TensorFlow machine learning framework so if you have Python and TensorFlow experience it is helpful, but not required.

At that point we took the images, converted them to TensorFlow records (TFRecords), and stored them to files.  [TFRecords](https://www.tensorflow.org/programmers_guide/reading_data) are a special file format provided by TensorFlow, which allow you to use built-in TensorFlow functions for data management including multi-threaded data reading and sophisticated pre-processing of the data such as randomizing and even augmenting the training data.\n",

    "TensorFlow is an open source software library for machine intelligence.  The computations are expressed as data flow graphs which operate on tensors (hence the name).  If you can express your computation in this manner you can run your algorithm in the TensorFlow framework.\n",

At present TensorFlow offers the options of expressing your computation in either Python or C++, with varying support for other [languages](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/) as well.  A typical usage of TensorFlow would be performing training and testing in Python and once you have finalized your model you might deploy with C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow is designed and built for performance on both CPUs and GPUs.  Within a single TensorFlow execution you have lots of flexibility in that you can assign different tasks to CPUs and GPUs explicitly if necessary.  When running on GPUs TensorFlow utilizes a number of GPU libraries including [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/cudnn) allowing it to extract the most performance possible from the very newest GPUs available.\n",

In the course of this short lab we won't be able to discuss all the features and options of TensorFlow but we hope that after completion of this lab you'll feel comfortable with and have a good idea how to move forward using TensorFlow to solve your specific machine learning problems.\n",

Using the TensorFlow API you construct a neural network layer-by-layer using any of the TensorFlow-provided operations such as convolutions, activations, pooling, etc.  This stage of the process doesn't do any actual computation on your data; it merely constructs the graph that you've specified.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you build the graph you must specify each so-called `Variable` (in TensorFlow lexicon).  Specifying a piece of data as a `Variable` tells TensorFlow that it will be a parameter to be \"learned\", i.e., it is a weight that will be updated as the training proceeds.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Session\n",

    "Once you've defined your neural network as a data flow graph, you will launch a `Session`.  This is the mechanism whereby you specify the input data and training parameters to your previously-constructed graph and then the computation proceeds.  \n",

    "Our second task will be to convert our model to a more sophisticated network that includes more layers and types than above.  The previous example focused on each individual pixel but had no way to account for the fact that the regions of interest are likely larger than a single pixel.  We'd like to capture small regions of interest as well and for that we'll utilize convolutional layers which can capture larger receptive fields.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We'll also add pooling layers which down-sample the data while attempting to retain most of the information.  This eliminates some computational complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point we've described layers that are commonly associated with image recognition neural networks, where the number of output nodes is equal to the number of classes.  Recall that we're doing more than classifying the image; we're classifying each pixel in the image so our output size will be the number of classes (2) times the number of pixels (256 x 256).  Additionally the spatial location of the output nodes are important as well, since each pixel has an associated probability that it's part of LV (or not). \n",
    "\n",
    "CNN's are well-established as excellent choices for image recognition or classification tasks.  Our task in this lab is segmentation, which is related to classification in a sense.  We are classifying each pixel in the image, rather than the entire image altogether.  So the question becomes, can we utilize the same type of CNN that is already shown to do very well on image recognition, for our task of segmentation?  It turns out that we can make some modifications to CNN models to do this.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can accomplish this by using a standard image recognition neural network, and replacing the fully-connected layers (typically the last few layers) with deconvolution layers (arguably more accurately called [transpose convolution](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn.html#conv2d_transpose) layers)\n",

When modifying a CNN to adapt it to segmentation the resulting neural network is commonly called a fully convolutional network, or FCN.\n",

However, notice from the images above that the region of LV is typically quite small compared to the entire image size.  This leads to a problem called class imbalance, i.e., one class is much more probable than the other class.  In our case, if we simply designed a network to output the class notLV for every output pixel, we'd still have something like 95% accuracy.  But that would be a seemingly useless network.

You also saw how choosing the correct accuracy metric is crucial in training the network.  Finally you had a chance to see how performing a parameter search is an integral part of the deep learning workflow to ultimately settle on a network that performs with acceptable accuracy for the task at hand."
